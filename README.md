I had to stop myself where I was. I would have done more for a responsive layout and probably worked on the visuals a little more.

I hope the UI is intiuitive. I would say this is my main weakness.

There is a lot of fun functional programming stuff with ramda in there. Check out the reducers.

My favorite part is if there is a long list of users, you can filter them by either email or a portion of their id number.
